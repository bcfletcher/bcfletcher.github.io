<H1>Welcome to my Github Site</H1>

This web page is primarily here so that Google will index my Github repos.

My Lego Projects repository can be found at <a href="https://github.com/bcfletcher/lego_projects">https://github.com/bcfletcher/lego_projects</a>

This repository is a set of Python scripts, Lego models (Bricklink Studio), Lego Spike Prime Python examples, Pybricks examples including a Robot Library, and a Python course I created to support efforts my son's First Lego League team.

All the non-Lego Python examples were created in Visual Studio Code for Mac.

The Lego Models were created using Bricklink Studio for Mac.

The Lego Python examples were created in Lego Spike Prime 3.4.3, Pybricks 3.5, or Pybricks 3.6 beta

All new Lego Python examples and my robot library will be for Pybricks. I have decided to move away from Lego Spike Prime due to lack of support by Lego, substantial number of bugs, poor documentation quality and completeness, and poor UI design choices. I strongly recommend any First Lego League (FLL) team that wants to develop in Python use Pybricks instead.
